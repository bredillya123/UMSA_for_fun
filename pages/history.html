						<p class="history__p">The problem of training dentists in Russia became especially acute in
							the XIX century. Dental care
							was not provided to patients due to lack of professionals, because they were not trained in
							Russia
							(until 1881) or in Ukraine (until 1900). In this regard, the outstanding surgeon of that
							time M.
							Sklifosovsky at the VI Congress of Naturalists and Physicians substantiated a proposal on
							the
							need
							to train dentists with higher medical education at medical faculties of universities. But
							only
							after
							the First World War the solution of the question of training dental professionals capable of
							providing qualified specialized care began to acquire real features.</p>

						<p class="history__p">In Kharkiv and Kyiv medical and dental communities of those years there
							was an
							opinion that
							qualified and specialized dental care for the population of Ukraine can be provided only by
							medical
							specialists who have chosen the profession of a dentist from the very beginning, from the
							first
							steps of training at dental faculties of medical institutes or medical dental institutes,
							where
							the
							period of study may be limited to four years.</p>

					<p class="history__p">On September 30, 1921, the Board of Ukrgolovprofos decided to establish a
						Faculty of Odontology as a part of the Kharkiv Medical Academy and conduct appropriate
						organizational activities, as well as to recruit students and staff members. On November 8,
						1921, at the meeting of the Small Board of Ukrgolovprofos, a decision was made to transform the
						Kharkiv Medical Academy into the medical institute with two faculties: Medical and Odontologic.
						This historic decision laid the foundation for higher dental education in Ukraine, and dentistry
						is recognized as an integral part of clinical medicine.</p>

					<p class="history__p">The legacy of the Odontologic Faculty was inherited by the Kharkiv
						Stomatological Institute in 1931, the Poltava Medical Stomatological Institute in 1967, and the
						Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy in 1994. In its formation and development, the
						Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy has passed a thorny path, which can be divided into six
						periods: the first: since the organization of the Faculty of Odontology at the Kharkiv Medical
						Academy (1921 - 1931); the second: since the transformation of the faculty into independent
						Kharkiv Stomatological Institute (1931 - 1941); the third is the period of evacuation to Frunze
						city (Kyrgyz SSR) and its functioning as a faculty of the Kyrgyz Medical Institute (1941 -
						1944); the fourth: re-evacuation to Kharkiv after its liberation from Nazi invaders, restoration
						of training bases and further development of scientific research (1944 - 1967); the fifth:
						transfer to Poltava and its transformation into Poltava Medical Stomatological Institute (1968 -
						1993); the sixth: since 1994, after the transformation of the institute into the Ukrainian
						Medical Stomatological Academy.</p>

					<h3 class="histiry__bold history__p">The first period (1921 - 1931)</h3>
					<span class="history__text">
						<p class="history__p">In September 1921, 250 people with secondary education began their studies
							at the first year of the Odontologic Faculty of the Kharkiv Medical Academy. The
							second-year-students involved 169 people who were enrolled for the second year of study at
							dental school and during the summer holidays studied a shortened course of medical and
							biological disciplines. At the faculty 4 special departments were formed, namely,
							Conservative Dentistry with Propaedeutic Odontology (headed by Professor Y. Gofung),
							Prosthetic Dentistry with Orthodontics (headed by I. Baranov), Oral and Maxillofacial
							Surgery (headed by Professor M. Fabrikant). Theoretical and general clinical disciplines
							were studied at the respective departments of the institute. Kharkiv State Stomatological
							School became the specialized medical facility of the faculty.</p>

						<p class="history__p">During its existence, the faculty has formed a capable, highly qualified,
							friendly team, which, along with solving educational problems, has made a significant
							contribution to the development of medical science. Faculty members have created 13
							textbooks on dentistry and numerous textbooks for students. Among the teachers who worked at
							the faculty in those years was a well-known anatomist, Academician V. Vorobyov, the author
							of outstanding works on the latest methods of embalming. It was he who was commissioned in
							1924 to embalm Lenin’s body.</p>

					<p class="history__p">Summing up the first decade of the faculty’s existence, it should be noted

						<p class="history__p">The process of the formation and further development of the Stomatological
							Faculty, and then the institute, happened in very difficult circumstances that developed in
							the country in the early 30’s. The economic difficulties experienced by the country and the
							search for ways out of them required measures to protect people’s health, expand the number
							of hospitals, sanatoriums, health resorts, dispensaries, dental clinics, etc. These and
							other problems could be solved only with better training of dental staff.</p>

						<p class="history__p">It was during this period, in August 1931, that the Stomatological Faculty
							at the Kharkiv Medical Institute was reorganized into independent Kharkiv Stomatological
							Institute with a 4-year term of study. 3 special departments were organized: Oral Surgery,
							Therapeutic Dentistry, Prosthetic Dentistry. Each department had its own affiliated training
							medical facility. The institute employed highly qualified teaching staff. M. Nezhdanov was
							appointed to the position of the Director of the institute, and Professor Y. Gofung was
							appointed as a Deputy Director for Research and Academic Activities. Almost all teachers at
							special departments had higher medical education.</p>

					<p class="history__p">On June 22, 1941, in the building 7, Pushkina Str., a scientific conference
						was held.</p>
					<p class="history__p">At 11:45 a break was taken, during which it became known about the treacherous
						attack of Nazi Germany on the Soviet Union. This message caused anger and indignation among

						Motherland. </p>
					<p class="history__p">Graduation ceremony of dentists was held on June 23, 1941. Dentists’ diplomas
						were awarded to 180 students. 62 students were transferred to the second year, 132 - to the
						third, 130 - to the fourth. On the same day, the Director of the institute, G. Lychman, issued
						an order demanding the dismissal of all those who were subject to conscription into the Red
						Army, to find alternatives of them, to pay their salaries in full, and made acceptance of all
						their files and materiel. Further, the order required to reorganize the groups for all courses,
						to make a schedule, to organize training according to the shortened academic plan issued by the
						People’s Commissariat of Health of the USSR in accordance with special instructions. In the
						first period, 45 people from Kharkiv Stomatological Institute joined the army. Among them were
						27 teachers, 16 employees and 2 students.</p>
					<p class="history__p">The fourth period (June 1944 - May 1967)</p>
					<p class="history__p">This time in the history of UMSA is characterized by the re-evacuation of the
						institute to Kharkiv, its formation and development in the post-war period. In July 1944,
						Professor P. Vlasenko, an experienced manager, an outstanding scientist, and a biologist by
						education, was appointed as the Director of the institute. The administration of the institute
						and some medical and biological departments were located in a 4-storey building on 53,
						Pushkinska Str. Anatomical departments were shared by students of medical and dental institutes,
						based at KhMI. General clinical departments were located on the affiliated city hospitals
						(Children’s Hospital, 2nd Soviet Hospital, etc.). Departments of ENT- and Ophthalmological
						Diseases were based on the corresponding scientific research institutes, and Dermatovenereal
						Diseases on the basis of the 4th Dermatovenereal Dispensary.</p>

				<span class="history__text">
					<p class="history__p">On May 12, 1967 the Council of Ministers of the USSR adopted Resolution №294
						on the transfer of the Kharkiv Medical Stomatological Institute to Poltava. In this regard, on
						May 18 of the same year the Ministry of Health of Ukraine issued Order №269 on the transfer of
						the Kharkiv Medical Stomatological Institute to Poltava during 1967-1968. The transfer was
						carried out in two stages.</p>
					<p class="history__p">At the first stage - in July - August 1967 - the departments of medical and
						biological profile were relocated and settled in Poltava in a 4-storey building in 23,
						Shevchenko Street till the beginning of the academic year, that was until September 1, 1967. At
						the second stage, in July - August 1968, the departments of clinical, including stomatological
						profile, were redeployed and the bases for their placement before the beginning of classes were
						prepared. In 1994, Poltava Medical Stomatological Institute received the highest IV level of
						accreditation and the status of the Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy. In 2014, the IV
						accreditation level was confirmed by the Accreditation Commission of Ukraine.</p>
					<p class="history__p">Students of all faculties are fully provided with workplaces equipped with
						modern techniques and facilities. For lectures, 7 classrooms with 150-250 seats each are used,
						which allows conducting classes with students in one shift. The Rectors and administration of
						the academy created the necessary conditions for conducting high-level educational activities by
						optimizing the methodology and content of training, increasing the exactingness and objectivity
						in assessing knowledge, improving the material support of the educational process, its
						personalization, and activating upbringing in the learning process.</p>
					<p class="history__p">In 2021, the Higher State Educational Institution of Ukraine "Ukrainian
						Medical Stomatological Academy" is going to celebrate its glorious anniversary - the 100th
						anniversary of the founding of Alma Mater.</p>
					<p class="history__p">Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy passed the long and glorious way of
						its development from the Faculty of Odontology, created as a part of the Kharkiv Medical Academy
						in 1921, to the leading specialized institution on training medical professionals, in
						particular, dentists.</p>
					<p class="history__p">In almost 100 years, the Academy has become an esteemed scientific centre for
						dental education in Ukraine.</p>
					<p class="history__p">The current period of the history of the Ukrainian Medical Stomatological
						Academy is the years of its international recognition. The rapid development of the educational
						institution, the opening of new faculties and specialities, the training of its own staff
						members within the academy, the introduction of new progressive forms and methods of work,
						awareness of the high mission of higher education is a strong guarantee of further development.
